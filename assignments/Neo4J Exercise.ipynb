    "# Exercise - Technical Comparison of an SQL and Graph Database\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise you are going to set up an SQL database of your choice and a Neo4j database. You will initialize the databases with data of an artificial social network. That network consists of persons, i.e., users of a platform such as LinkedIn, and endorsements, i.e., the acknowledgment of another person. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data is given to you in CSV files. You can see small examples here, where one CSV file contains the data for the graph nodes and the other CSV file contains the data for the edges:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2018spring-databases-teaching-material/blob/master/data/social_network_nodes_small.csv\n",
    "  * https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2018spring-databases-teaching-material/blob/master/data/social_network_edges_small.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "**OBS:** The two files above are only small examples to understand how the data is structured. For your exercise you will use the **complete** dataset containing 500.000 nodes and some millions of edges:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2018spring-databases-teaching-material/raw/master/data/archive_graph.tar.gz.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this exercise is, that you execute a small experiment in which you compare runtimes of various queries on the two databases and report the measured results as well as a possible explanation and conclusions for the observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Precisely, your task is:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Setup an SQL and a Neo4j database respectively.\n",
    "  2. Import the data from the social network (endorsement graph https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2018spring-databases-teaching-material/raw/master/data/archive_graph.tar.gz) into a Neo4j database and into an SQL database respectively.\n",
    "  3. Construct queries in SQL and in Cypher, which find\n",
    "\n",
    "     1. all persons that a person endorses, i.e., endorsements of depth one.\n",
    "     2. all persons that are endorsed by endorsed persons of a person, i.e., endorsements of depth two.\n",
    "     3. endorsements of depth three.\n",
    "     4. endorsements of depth four.\n",
    "     5. endorsements of depth five.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. Write a program in a programming language of your choice, such as Java, C\\#, etc., where the program executes the above queries for **twenty** random nodes against the two respective databases. That is, you run each query on the same twenty random nodes.\n",
    "  5. Extend your program, so that it measures the average and median execution times of each query. That is, you run a benchmark for the two databases.\n",
    "  6. You collect your measurement results and present them with an evaluation of your experiment in a Markdown file in a repository on Github. That is, you hand in this assignment via Github.\n",
    "    * Describe the setup of your experiment. That is, what does someone has to do/install/setup to reproduce your experiment?\n",
    "    * Present the execution time of each query each of the 20 random nodes/persons per database.\n",
    "    * Present the average and the median runtime of each of the queries per database.\n",
    "    * Give an explanation of the differences in your time measurements. \n",
    "    * Conclude which database is better suited for this kind of queries and explain why.\n",
    "  7. Push your solution, source, code, and presentation of the results to a Github repository *and* hand-in a link to that repository on peergrade.\n",
    "  8. The *hand-in* time is latest 24. April 2018 at 24o'clock .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Independently of your setup, i.e., if you have the databases installed directly to your host machine or within a Docker container, you likely want to give Neo4j access to more memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "  **OBS** The Neo4j standard configuration is low on RAM. To receive meaningful results that do not measure RAM swapping times you have to increase RAM in the Neo4j configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Follow the _Memory Configuration guidelines_ on https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-performance-tuning/\n",
    "and the _Memory configuration_ on https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/performance/memory-configuration/#heap-sizing\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Direct installation on host**: You can set the configuration variables (`dbms.memory.heap.initial_size`, `dbms.memory.heap.max_size`, and `dbms.memory.pagecache.size`) directly in the configuration file under `$NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Installation within Docker**: You can set the configuration variables (`dbms.memory.heap.initial_size`, `dbms.memory.heap.max_size`, and `dbms.memory.pagecache.size`) via the following environment variables when starting the container `--env=NEO4J_dbms_memory_pagecache_size=xG`, `--env=NEO4J_dbms_memory_heap_initial__size=xG`, `--env=NEO4J_dbms_memory_heap_max__size=xG`, where `x` is an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. In SQL you can load a CSV file as in the following\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '/path/to/social_network_nodes.csv'\n",
    "  INTO TABLE yourdb.t_user\n",
    "  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '\"'\n",
    "  LINES TERMINATED BY '\\n'\n",
    "  IGNORE 1 LINES\n",
    "  (id,name,job,birthday)\n",
    "  ;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. Present your measurement results in an understandable way. For example in a table similar to the following:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "                     MySQL              Neo4j       \n",
    "                   average   median average median\n",
    "Depth one:     0.5       0.4       2.1     1.4\n",
    "Depth two:     1.8       17.0      2.5     2.1\n",
    "Depth three:     57.5      17.0      11.5    7.3\n",
    "Depth four:   1716.1    517.9     208.9   80.5\n",
    "Depth five:   204874.4  70712.5   4647.8  1549.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
